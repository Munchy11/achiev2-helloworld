### Hello World! Achievement



1. I started off by cloning my GitHub repo
2. I then proceeded to follow the intructions given, and used the command $ npm init to get my package.json file.
3. Created my app.js file
4. I Made sure to make my .gitignore file early so i knew something couldn't wrong as "easily"
5. Proceeded to install express by doing $ npm i express (hot key) then instantly placed it in my .gitignorefile
6. Copy and pasted the code given into my project file
7. Final step i loaded the http://localhost:3000/ and the results came back

Overall, i'm still confused on what even happened so i will be doing some research on this topic, but very interesting assignment.
